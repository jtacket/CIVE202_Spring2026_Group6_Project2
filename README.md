NDOT has chosen our firm to convert their Excel-based concrete mix design model into a Python-based system. The main goal is to replicate the logic in the Excel “Mix Design” worksheet into python. This will allow users to input design parameters and material properties in a clean and structured manner. This will then create an output that generates a weight chart for one cubic yard of concrete. Migrating the Excel model to Python will allow for future integration into a web-based tool.
